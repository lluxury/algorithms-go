Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

- t是有s的字符串打乱之后，再加一个字符组成的
- 本题使用了[single-number](./136-single-number.md)的技巧
